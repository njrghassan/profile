            <section>
                <p>Lilya is a second-year student pursuing nursing at Mount Royal University, because of doctors and
                    nurses who helped in the birth of her sister she was inspired to help people with a greater passion
                    for helping babies and children as inspired by her sister. Moreover, Lilya’s family is very
                    important to her and because of the war between Russia and Ukraine, they are more separated than
                    ever while having issues gathering due to bad conditions and lack of flights to that area. However,
                    she plans to meet her parents in Turkey since most countries have good relationships with them even
                    though it costs a lot of money but as Lilya said, “God and then Family are the most important, so
                    don’t let life get in the way”. An interesting fact about Lilya is photography is her hobby and she
                    is very talented in it, I find this fascinating because her photos have a sense of peace and
                    happiness in them. All in all, Lilya is a caring person with much potential in a life filled with
                    beauty and success.</p>
