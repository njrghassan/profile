            <section>
                <h2 class="fw-bold">Inroduction</h2>
                <p>I’ve never met anyone caring and passionate about their goals, but that changed when I met Lilya
                    Oleshchinskaia, a dedicated student pursuing Nursing at Mount Royal University on her way to her
                    third year. Lilya’s motivation for helping babies and children started when on the day of her
                    sister's birth which was a big part of why she decided to choose Nursing and her passion for helping
                    others.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, her caring about her family is an unbreakable kindness and highlights how worried is
                    she about them because they have issues gathering, and that’s due to the conflict between Russia and
                    Ukraine which lead to unreliable conditions and lack of flights on these areas because they are
                    considered as dangerous areas by the EASA <a
                        href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-europe-airlines-russia-ukraine-airspace/index.html"
                        target="_blank">(Xu, 2023)</a>. However, she will be seeing her parents in
                    Turkey, since they have good relationships with most countries 
                    <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-03-08/turkeys-erdogan-offers-to-host-a-peace-summit-with-russia-during-a-visit-from-ukraines-zelenskyy" target="_blank">
                        (Wieting & Fraser, 2024)</a>,
                    and as Lilya says, “God and then Family are the most important, so don’t let life get in the way”.

            <section>
                <h2 class="fw-bold">One Interesting Factoid</h2>
                <p>An interesting fact about Lilya is that photography is her favorite hobby, and she is very talented
                    in it as she always takes pictures anywhere of anything she finds interesting. I find this
                    fascinating because her photos talk by themselves and have a sense of peace and beauty in them.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="fw-bold">Behind the Scene</h2>
                <p>During my conversation with Lilya, we were located at the campus of our university on the roof of the
                    building where it was cloudy. The cloud gave me the perfect lighting as it was very bright and not
                    dim, so getting the right angle to match the lighting wasn’t hard at all since everywhere had the
                    same level of brightness.
                    <br><br>
                    Behind the bench, there were still growing bushes and leaves was the
                    perfect background with the building behind to show that it’s an institution place and a bit of blur
                    to highlight focus on the Lilya as she is the main story of the image. Lilya’s pose highlighted that
                    she is a part of the place and that she is confident in herself. The smile gave more peacefulness to
                    the image and added more to her personality.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, the camera angle was a straightforward shot focusing directly on her, but there was a
                    slight dent in the angle which resulted left side to be more higher which happened accidentally.
